<p>This document outlines a common workflow for using the Open Specy app
and highlights some topics that users are often requesting a tutorial
on. If the document is followed sequentially from beginning to end, the
user will have a better understanding of every procedure involved in
using the Open Specy R app as a tool for interpreting spectra. It takes
approximately 45 minutes to read through and follow along with this
standard operating procedure the first time. Afterward, knowledgeable
users should be able to thoroughly analyze spectra at an average speed
of 1 min<sup>-1</sup> or faster with the new batch and automated
procedures. If you are looking for documentation about the R package
please see the <a href="http://wincowger.com/OpenSpecy-package/articles/sop.html">package

<p>To get started with the Open Specy user interface, access <a href="https://openanalysis.org/openspecy/" class="external-link">https://openanalysis.org/openspecy/</a>
or start the Shiny GUI directly from your own computer in R. If using
the package, you just need to read in the library and run the command
<code><a href="../reference/run_app.html">run_app()</a></code>.</p>

<p>Once the app is open, if you have your own data, click
<strong>Browse</strong> at the top left hand corner of the Analyze
Spectra tab.</p>
<p><img src="app%2Fmainpage.jpg" width="98%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Before uploading, indicate if you would like to share the uploaded
data or not using the slider. If selected, any data uploaded to the tool
will automatically be shared under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" class="external-link">CC-BY 4.0
license</a> and will be available for researchers and other ventures to
use to improve spectral analysis, build machine learning tools, etc.
Some users may choose not to share if they need to keep their data
private. If switched off, none of the uploaded data will be stored or
shared in Open Specy.</p>
<p><img src="app%2Fuploadfile.jpg" width="137" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Open Specy allows for upload of native Open Specy .y(a)ml, .json, or
.rds files. In addition, .csv, .asp, .jdx, .0, .spa, .spc, and .zip
files can be imported. .zip files can either contain multiple files with
individual spectra in them of the non-zip formats or it can contain a
.hdr and .dat file that form an ENVI file for a spectral map. Open Specy
and .csv files should always load correctly but the other file types are
still in development, though most of the time these files work
perfectly. If uploading a .csv file, label the column with the
wavenumbers <code>wavenumber</code> and name the column with the
intensities <code>intensity</code>. Wavenumber units must be
cm<sup>-1</sup>. Any other columns are not used by the software. Always
keep a copy of the original file before alteration to preserve metadata
and raw data for your records.</p>

<p>It is best practice to cross check files in the proprietary software
they came from and Open Specy before use in Open Specy. Due to the
complexity of some proprietary file types, we haven’t been able to make
them fully compatible yet. If your file is not working, please contact
the administrator and share the file so that we can work on integrating
it.</p>
<p>The specific steps to converting your instrument’s native files to
.csv can be found in its software manual or you can check out <a href="https://www.effemm2.de/spectragryph/" class="external-link">Spectragryph</a>, which
supports many spectral file conversions see <a href="http://wincowger.com/OpenSpecy-package/articles/spectragryph.html">Spectragryph
Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>If you don’t have your own data, you can use a test dataset.</p>
<p><img src="app%2Fsamplefile.jpg" width="134" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>A .csv file of an HDPE Raman spectrum will download on your computer.
This file can also be used as a template for formatting .csv data into
an Open Specy accepted format.</p>

</h3>
<p>In the app after spectral data are uploaded, it will appear in the
main window. This plot is selectable, zoomable, and provides information
on hover. You can also save a .png file of the plot view using the
camera icon at the top right when you hover over the plot.</p>
<p><img src="app%2Fspectra_vis.jpg" width="210" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="maps">Maps<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#maps"></a>
</h3>
<p>Spectral maps can also be visualized as overlaid spectra but in
addition the spatial information can be plotted as a heatmap. A similar
plot should appear in the app if you upload multiple spectra or a
spectral map. It is important to note that when multiple spectra are
uploaded in batch they are prescribed <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
coordinates, this can be helpful for visualizing summary statistics and
navigating vast amounts of data but shouldn’t be confused with data
which actually has spatial coordinates. Hovering over the map will
reveal information about the signal and noise and correlation values.
Clicking the map will provide the selected spectrum underneath. In the
app, the colors of the heatmap are either the signal and noise or the
spectral identifications depending on whether the identification is
turned on or not. Pixels are black if the spectra does not pass the
signal-noise threshold and/or the correlation threshold.</p>
<p><img src="app%2Fmap_vis.jpg" width="210" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="processing">Processing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#processing"></a>
</h2>
<p>The goal of this processing is to increase the signal to noise ratio
(S/N) without distorting the shape or relative size of the peaks. After
uploading data, you can process the data using intensity adjustment,
baseline subtraction, smoothing, flattening, and range selection and
save your processed data. Once the process button is selected the
default processing will initiate. This is an absolute derivative
transformation, it is kind of magic, it does something similar to
smoothing, baseline subtraction, and intensity correction simultaneously
and really quickly. By clicking processing you should see the spectrum
update with the processed spectra.</p>
<p><img src="app%2Fprocessing.jpg" width="210" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>To view the raw data again, just deselect processing. Toggling
processing on and off can help you to make sure that the spectra are
processed correctly.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="threshold-signal-noise">Threshold Signal-Noise<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#threshold-signal-noise"></a>
</h3>
<p>Considering whether you have enough signal to analyze spectra is
important. Classical spectroscopy would recommend your highest peak to
be at least 10 times the baseline of your processed spectra before you
begin analysis. If your spectra is below that threshold, you may want to
consider recollecting it. In practice, we are rarely able to collect
spectra of that good quality and more often use 5. The Signal Over Noise
technique searches your spectra for high and low regions and conducts
division on them to derive the signal to noise ratio. Signal Times Noise
multiplies the mean signal by the standard deviation of the signal and
Total Signal sums the intensities. The latter can be really useful for
thresholding spectral maps to identify particles which we will discuss
later.</p>
<p><img src="app%2Fsnr_threshold.jpg" width="200" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>If analyzing spectra in batch, we recommend looking at the heatmap
and optimizing the percent of spectra that are above your signal to
noise threshold to determine the correct settings instead of looking
through spectra individually. Good Signal tells you what percent of your
data are above your signal threshold.</p>
<p><img src="app%2Fsignal_settings.jpg" width="318" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="intensity-adjustment">Intensity Adjustment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#intensity-adjustment"></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="app%2Fintensityadjustment.jpg" width="195" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Open Specy assumes that intensity units are in absorbance units but
Open Specy can adjust reflectance or transmittance spectra to absorbance
units using this selection. The transmittance adjustment uses the
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mo>log</mo><mn>10</mn></msub><mn>1</mn><mi>/</mi><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\log_{10} 1/T</annotation></semantics></math>
calculation which does not correct for system or particle
characteristics. The reflectance adjustment use the Kubelka-Munk
equation
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mfrac><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><mi>R</mi><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>R</mi></mrow></mfrac><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{(1-R)^2}{2R}</annotation></semantics></math>.
If none is selected, Open Specy assumes that the uploaded data is an
absorbance spectrum and does not apply an adjustment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="conforming">Conforming<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conforming"></a>
</h3>
<p>Conforming spectra is essential before comparing to a reference
library and can be useful for summarizing data when you don’t need it to
be highly resolved spectrally. In the app, conforming happens behind the
scenes without any user input to make sure that the spectra the user
uploads and the library spectra will be compatible. We set the spectral
resolution to 8 because this tends to be pretty good for a lot of
applications and is in between 4 and 8 which are commonly used
wavenumber resolutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="smoothing">Smoothing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#smoothing"></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="app%2Fsmoothingpoly.jpg" width="230" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The value on the slider is the polynomial order of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter" class="external-link">Savitzky-Golay
(SG) filter</a>. Higher numbers lead to more wiggly fits and thus less
smooth, lower numbers lead to more smooth fits. The SG filter is fit to
a moving window of 11 data points by default where the center point in
the window is replaced with the polynomial estimate. Larger windows will
produce smoother fits. The derivative order is set to 1 by default which
transforms the spectra to their first derivative. A zero order
derivative will have no derivative transformation. When smoothing is
done well, peak shapes and relative heights should not change. The
absolute value is primarily useful for first derivative spectra where
the absolute value results in an absorbance-like spectrum which is why
we set it as the default.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="baseline-correction">Baseline Correction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#baseline-correction"></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="app%2Fbaselinecorrectionpoly.jpg" width="200" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The goal of baseline correction is to get all non-peak regions of the
spectra to zero absorbance. The higher the polynomial order, the more
wiggly the fit to the baseline. If the baseline is not very wiggly, a
more wiggly fit could remove peaks which is not desired. The baseline
correction algorithm used in Open Specy is called “iModPolyfit” (Zhao et
al. 2007). This algorithm iteratively fits polynomial equations of the
specified order to the whole spectrum. During the first fit iteration,
peak regions will often be above the baseline fit. The data in the peak
region is removed from the fit to make sure that the baseline is less
likely to fit to the peaks. The iterative fitting terminates once the
difference between the new and previous fit is small. An example of a
good baseline fit below. For those who have been with OpenSpecy a while,
you will notice the app no longer supports manual baseline correction,
it was a hard choice but it just didn’t make sense to keep it now that
we are moving toward high throughput automated methods. It does still
exist in the R function though.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="range-selection">Range Selection<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#range-selection"></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="app%2Frangeselection.jpg" width="190" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Sometimes an instrument operates with high noise at the ends of the
spectrum and, a baseline fit produces distortions, or there are regions
of interest for analysis. Range selection accomplishes those goals. You
should look into the signal to noise ratio of your specific instrument
by wavelength to determine what wavelength ranges to use. Distortions
due to baseline fit can be assessed from looking at the process spectra.
Additionally, you can restrict the range to examine a single peak or a
subset of peaks of interests. The maximum and minimum wavenumbers will
specify the range to keep in the app.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="flattening-ranges">Flattening Ranges<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#flattening-ranges"></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="app%2Fflattten_example.jpg" width="195" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Sometimes there are peaks that really shouldn’t be in your spectra
and can distort your interpretation of the spectra but you don’t
necessarily want to remove the regions from the analysis because you
believe those regions should be flat instead of having a peak. One way
to deal with this is to replace the peak values with the mean of the
values around the peak. This is the purpose of the Flatten Range. By
default it is set to flatten the CO2 region for FTIR spectra because
that region often needs to be flattened when atmospheric artifacts occur
in spectra.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="min-max-normalization">Min-Max Normalization<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#min-max-normalization"></a>
</h3>
<p>Min-Max normalization is used throughout the app but is not one of
the options the user can specify. Often we regard spectral intensities
as arbitrary and min-max normalization allows us to view spectra on the
same scale without drastically distorting their shapes or relative peak
intensities. In the app, it is primarily used for plotting and as a
processing step before correlation analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="downloading-processed-data">Downloading Processed Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#downloading-processed-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>You can download a csv file of your processed data using the Your
Spectra option with download. This will download a version of your
spectra with whatever processing options you have selected at the
time.</p>

</h2>
<p><img src="app%2Fidentification.jpg" width="210" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>After uploading data and processing it (if desired) you can now
identify the spectrum. To identify the spectrum go to the
<strong>Identification</strong> box. Pro tip: if you select
<strong>Identification</strong> without uploading data to the app,
you’ll be able to explore the library by itself.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="reading-libraries">Reading Libraries<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reading-libraries"></a>
</h3>
<p>These options define the strategy for identification. The <strong>ID
Library</strong> will inform which library is used. Both (default) will
search both FTIR and Raman libraries. Deriv will search against a
derivative transformed library. No Baseline will search against a
baseline corrected library. This should be in line with how you choose
to process your spectra. Cor options use a simple Pearson correlation
search algorithm. AI is currently experimental and uses either a
multinomial model or correlation on mediod spectra from the library.
Correlation thresholding will set the minimum value from matching to use
as a ‘positive identification’ this will black out pixels in a spectral
map view if they are lower than the threshold.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="matches">Matches<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#matches"></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="app%2Fmatches.jpg" width="360" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Top matches in the app can be assessed by clicking the cog in the
right hand corner of the Spectra box. This will open a side window with
the matches sorted from most to least similar. Clicking on rows in the
table will add the selected match to the spectra viewer. Using the
table’s filter options, you can restrict the range of Pearson's r values
or search for specific material types.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="selection-metadata">Selection Metadata<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#selection-metadata"></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="app%2Fselectionmetadata.jpg" width="98%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Whatever match is selected from the match table may have additional
metadata about it. That metadata will be displayed below the plot. Some
of this metadata may assist you in interpreting the spectra. For
example, if the spectra has metadata which says it is a liquid and you
are analyzing a solid particle, that spectrum may not be the best
match.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="match-plot">Match Plot<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#match-plot"></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="app%2Fmatchplot.jpg" width="318" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>This plot is dynamically updated by selecting matches from the match
table. The red spectrum is the spectrum that you selected from the
reference library and the white spectrum is the spectrum that you are
trying to identify. Whenever a new dataset is uploaded, the plot and
data table in this tab will be updated. These plots can be saved as a
.png by clicking the camera button at the top of the plot.</p>

<p>Thresholding only works and shouldn’t be used for single particles.
You can threshold spectral maps using the signal-noise values and/or the
correlation threshold. Whatever selection you have active will inform
how your spectra is thresholded. It should get thresholded in
coincidence with what you see on the spectral map. Pro tip: The file
that gets downloaded is an OpenSpecy with median spectra for each of
your thresholded particles. You can upload that back to the app and
analyze that independently.</p>
