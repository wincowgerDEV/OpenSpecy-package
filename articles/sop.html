<p>This document outlines a common workflow for using the Open Specy
package and highlights some topics that users are often requesting a
tutorial on. If the document is followed sequentially from beginning to
end, the user will have a better understanding of every procedure
involved in using the Open Specy R package as a tool for interpreting
spectra. It takes approximately 45 minutes to read through and follow
along with this standard operating procedure the first time. Afterward,
knowledgeable users should be able to thoroughly analyze spectra at an
average speed of 1 min<sup>-1</sup> or faster with the new batch and
automated procedures.</p>
<p>The Open Specy R package is the backbone of the Shiny app. The choice
is yours as to which you start with, we use both on a regular basis. The
tutorial will talk through the R functions you can use to
programatically analyze spectra. If you are looking for a tutorial about
how to use the app see <a href="https://wincowger.com/OpenSpecy-package/articles/app.html" class="external-link">this

<p>Open Specy allows for upload of native Open Specy .csv, .y(a)ml,
.json, or .rds files. Open Specy and .csv files should always load
correctly but the other file types are still in development, though most
of the time these files work perfectly. In addition, .csv, .asp, .jdx,
.0, .spa, .spc, and .zip files can be imported. .zip files can either
contain multiple files with individual spectra in them of the non-zip
formats or it can contain a .hdr and .dat file that form an ENVI file
for a spectral map. If uploading a .csv file, it is ideal to label the
column with the wavenumbers <code>wavenumber</code> and name the column
with the intensities <code>intensity</code>. Columns besides wavenumber
will be interpreted as unique spectra. If any columns are numbers, the
csv will be interpreted in wide format with the number columns the
wavenumbers and rows containing the unique spectral intensities and
metadata contained in non number columns. Wavenumber units should be
cm<sup>-1</sup> or use <code><a href="../reference/adj_wave.html">adj_wave()</a></code> to correct from
wavelength. Always keep a copy of the original file before alteration to
preserve metadata and raw data for your records.</p>
<p>It is best practice to cross check files in the proprietary software
they came from and Open Specy before use in Open Specy. Due to the
complexity of some proprietary file types, we haven’t been able to make
them fully compatible yet. If your file is not working, please contact
the administrator and share the file so that we can work on integrating
it.</p>
<p>The specific steps to converting your instrument’s native files to
.csv can be found in its software manual or you can check out <a href="https://www.effemm2.de/spectragryph/" class="external-link">Spectragryph</a>, which
supports many spectral file conversions. For instructions, see <a href="https://wincowger.com/OpenSpecy-package/articles/spectragryph.html" class="external-link">Spectragryph
Tutorial</a>. Unfortunately the maintainer of Spectragryph passed away
and it is unclear how much longer this will be supported.</p>
<p>If you don’t have your own data, you can use a test dataset.</p>

<p>You will notice now that the R package reads in files into an object
with class <code>OpenSpecy</code>. This is a class we created for high
throughput spectral analysis which now also preserves spectral metadata.
You can even create these from scratch if you’d like.</p>

<p>Open Specy objects are lists with three components,
<code>wavenumber</code> is a vector of the wavenumber values for the
spectra and corresponds to the rows in <code>spectra</code> which is a
<code>data.table</code> where each column is a set of spectral
intensities. <code>metadata</code> is a data.table which holds
additional information about the spectra. Each row in
<code>metadata</code> corresponds to a column in
<code>spectra</code>.</p>

<p>Open Specy objects can be saved most accurately as .csv, .rds, .yml,
or .json files. .rds will be the most reproducible as it is a native R
file format and floating point errors can happen with .csv, .json, or
.yml.</p>

<p>Another great spectroscopy R package is <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hyperSpec" class="external-link">hyperSpec</a>. We
actually depend on their functions for several of ours. They are
currently making some awesome new features and we want to integrate well
with them so that both packages can be easily used together. That is why
we created the <code>as_hyperSpec</code> function and made sure that
<code>as_OpenSpecy</code> can convert from <code>hyperSpec</code>
objects.</p>

<p>Spectral maps can also be visualized as overlaid spectra but in
addition the spatial information can be plotted as a heatmap. It is
important to note that when multiple spectra are uploaded in batch they
are prescribed <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates, this can
be helpful for visualizing summary statistics and navigating vast
amounts of data but shouldn’t be confused with data which actually has
spatial coordinates.</p>
<p>In R the user can control what values form the colors of the heatmap
by specifying <code>z</code>, it is handy to put the information you
want in the metadata for this reason. This example just shows the x
values of the spectra.</p>

<p>An interactive plot of the heatmap and spectra overlayed can be

hover over the heatmap to identify the next row id they are interested
in and update the value of select to see that spectrum.</p>

into one. The easiest way to do that is by having spectra which all are
in the same exact format with the same series of wavenumbers. The
default settings of <code>c_spec</code> assume that is the case.</p>
<p>If you have different wavenumber ranges for the spectra you want to
combine, you can set <code>range = "common"</code> and <code>res</code>
equal to the wavenumber resolution you want and the function will
collapse all the spectra to whatever their common range is using linear
interpolation.</p>

</h2>
<p>The goal of processing is to increase the signal to noise ratio (S/N)
of the spectra and remove unwanted artifacts without distorting the
shape, position, or relative size of the peaks. After loading data, you
can process the data using intensity adjustment, baseline subtraction,
smoothing, flattening, and range selection. The default settings is an
absolute first derivative transformation. It is really powerful for many
data issues. It does something similar to smoothing, baseline
subtraction, and intensity correction simultaneously and really
quickly.</p>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/process_spec.html">process_spec()</a></code> function is a monolithic function for
all processing procedures which is optimized by default to result in
high signal to noise in most cases, same as the app.</p>

<p>We want people to use the <code><a href="../reference/process_spec.html">process_spec()</a></code> function for
most processing operations. All other processing functions can be tuned
using its parameters in the single function see

nesting of functions and order of operations can be useful for users to
control so you can also use individual functions for each operation if
you’d like. See explanations of each processing sub-function below.</p>

<h3 id="threshold-signal-and-noise">Threshold Signal and Noise<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#threshold-signal-and-noise"></a>
</h3>
<p>Considering whether you have enough signal to analyze spectra in the
first place is important, because if you don’t have enough signal you
should recollect the spectrum. Classical spectroscopy would recommend
your highest peak to be at least 10 times greater than the baseline of
your processed spectra before you begin analysis. Setting a threshold
can assist in standardized differentiation between low and high quality
spectral. If your spectra is below that threshold even after processing,
you may want to consider recollecting it. In practice, we are rarely
able to collect spectra of that good quality and more often use 4 as a
lower bound with anything below 2 being completely unusable. The
“run_sig_over_noise” <code>metric</code> searches your spectra for high
and low regions and conducts division on them to derive the signal to
noise ratio. In the example below you can see that our signal to noise
ratio is increased by the processing, the goal of processing is
generally to maximize the signal to noise ratio. If you know where your
signal region and noise regions are, you can specify them with
<code>sig_min</code>, <code>sig_max</code>, <code>noise_min</code>, and
<code>noise_max</code>.</p>

</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter" class="external-link">Savitzky-Golay
filter</a> is used for smoothing. Higher polynomial numbers lead to more
wiggly fits and thus less smoothing, lower numbers lead to more smooth
fits. The SG filter is fit to a moving window of 11 data points by
default where the center point in the window is replaced with the
polynomial estimate. Larger windows will produce smoother fits. The
derivative order is set to 1 by default which transforms the spectra to
their first derivative. A zero order derivative will have no derivative
transformation and only apply smoothing. When smoothing is done well,
peak shapes and relative heights should not change. The absolute value
is primarily useful for first derivative spectra where the result looks
similar to absorbance units and is easy to have intuition about.</p>

<h3 id="baseline-correction">Baseline Correction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#baseline-correction"></a>
</h3>
<p>The goal of baseline correction is to get all non-peak regions of the
spectra to zero absorbance. The higher the polynomial order, the more
wiggly the fit to the baseline. If the baseline is not very wiggly, a
more wiggly fit could remove peaks which is not desired. The baseline
correction algorithm used in Open Specy is called “iModPolyfit” (Zhao et
al. 2007). This algorithm iteratively fits polynomial equations of the
specified order to the whole spectrum. During the first fit iteration,
peak regions will often be above the baseline fit. The data in the peak
region is removed from the fit to make sure that the baseline is less
likely to fit to the peaks. The iterative fitting terminates once the
difference between the new and previous fit is small. An example of a
good baseline fit below. Manual baseline correction can also be
specified by providing a baseline <code>OpenSpecy</code> object. There
are many fine tuning options that can be chosen, see
<code>?subtr_baseline()</code> for more details.</p>

<p>Sometimes an instrument operates with high noise at the ends of the
spectrum and, a baseline fit produces distortions, or there are regions
of interest for analysis. Range selection accomplishes those goals. Many
of these issues can be resolved during spectral collection by specifying
a wavenumber range which is well characterized by the instrument.
Multiple ranges can be specified simultaneously.</p>

<p>Sometimes there are peaks that really shouldn’t be in your spectra
and can distort your interpretation of the spectra but you don’t
necessarily want to remove the regions from the analysis because you
believe those regions should exist and be flat instead of having a peak.
One way to deal with this is to replace the peak values with the mean of
the values around the peak. This is the purpose of the
<code>flatten_range</code> function. By default it is set to flatten the
CO2 region for FTIR spectra because that region often needs to be
flattened when atmospheric artifacts occur in spectra. Like
<code>restrict_range</code>, the R function can accept multiple
ranges.</p>

<p>Reference libraries are spectra with known identities. The Open Specy
library now has over 30,000 spectra in it and is getting so large that
we cannot fit it within the R package size limit of 5 MB. We host the
reference libraries on <a href="https://osf.io/x7dpz/" class="external-link">OSF</a> and have
a function to pull the libraries down automatically. Running get_lib by
itself will download all libraries to your package directory or you can
specify which libraries you want and where you want them.</p>

<p>After download you can load the libraries into your active

<p>Before attempting to use a reference library to identify spectra it
is really important to understand what format the reference library is
in. All the OpenSpecy reference libraries are in Absorbance units.
<code>derivative</code> has been absolute first derivative transformed,
<code>nobaseline</code> has been baseline corrected, <code>raw</code> is
the rawest form of the reference spectra (not recommended except for
advanced uses). The previously mentioned libraries all have Raman and
FTIR spectra in them. <code>mediod_{derivative or nobasline}</code> is
the mediod compressed library version of the libraries and has only
critical spectra in it, <code>model{derivative or nobasline}</code> is
an exception because it is a multinomial regression approach for
identification. In this example we use the <code>data("test_lib")</code>
which is a subsampled version of the <code>derivative</code> library and
<code>data("raman_hdpe")</code> which is an unprocessed Raman spectrum
in absorbance units of HDPE plastic.</p>

<p>After your spectra is processed similarly to the library
specifications, you can identify the spectra using
<code><a href="../reference/match_spec.html">match_spec()</a></code>. Whichever library you choose, you need to get
your spectra into a similar enough format to use for comparison. The
<code>add_library_metadata</code> and <code>add_object_metadata</code>
options specify the column name in the metadata that you want to add
metadata from and <code>top_n</code> specifies how many matches you
want. In this example we just identified a single spectrum with the
library but you can also send an OpenSpecy object with multiple spectra.
The output <code>matches</code> is a data.table with at least 3 columns,
<code>object_id</code> tells you the column names of the spectra in
<code>x</code>, <code>library_id</code> tells you the column names from
the library that it matched to. <code>match_val</code> is the value of
the Pearson correlation coefficient (default) or other correlation if
specified in <code>...</code> or if using the model identification
option <code>match_val</code> will be the model confidence. The output
in this example returned the correct material type, HDPE, as the top
match. If using Pearson correlation, 0.7 is a good threshold to use for
a positive ID. In this example, only our top match is greater than the
threshold so we would disregard the other matches. If no matches were
above our threshold, we would proclaim that the spectrum is of an
unknown identity. You’ll also notice in this example that we matched to
a library with both Raman and FTIR spectra but the Raman spectra had the
highest hits, this is the rationale for lazily matching to a library
with both. If you want to just match to a library with FTIR or Raman
spectra, you can first filter the library using
<code><a href="../reference/match_spec.html">filter_spec()</a></code> using <code>SpectrumType</code>.</p>

<p>Sometimes the spectroscopy task we want to perform is to identify
particles in a spectral map. This is especially common for microplastic
analysis where a spectral map is used to image a sample and spectral
information is used to differentiate microplastic particles from
nonplastic particles. In addition to the material id, one often wants to
measure the shape and size of the particles. In a brute force technique,
one could first identify every spectrum in the map, then use
thresholding and image analysis to measure the particles. However, more
often than not, particles are well separated on the image surface and
background spectra is quite different from particle spectra and
therefore we can use thresholding a priori to identify and measure the
particles, then pass an exemplary spectrum for each particle to the
identification routine. It is important to note here that this is at the
bleeding edge of theory and technique so we may be updating these
functions in the near future.</p>
