# Document Overview 

This document outlines a common workflow for using the Open Specy app and
highlights some topics that users are often requesting a tutorial on. If the
document is followed sequentially from beginning to end, the user will have a
better understanding of every procedure involved in using the Open Specy R app
as a tool for interpreting spectra. It takes approximately 45 minutes to read
through and follow along with this standard operating procedure the first time.
Afterward, knowledgeable users should be able to thoroughly analyze spectra at
an average speed of 1 min^-1^ or faster with the new batch and automated
procedures. If you are looking for documentation about the R package please see
the [package vignette](https://raw.githack.com/wincowgerDEV/OpenSpecy-package/main/docs/articles/sop.html)

# Running the App

To get started with the Open Specy user interface, access
[https://openanalysis.org/openspecy/](https://openanalysis.org/openspecy/) or
start the Shiny GUI directly from your own computer in R. If using the package,
you just need to read in the library and run the command `run_app()`.

```{r eval = F}
install.packages("OpenSpecy")
```

```{r setup}
library(OpenSpecy)
```

```{r eval = F}
run_app()
```

# Reading Data

Once the app is open, if you have your own data, click **Browse** at the top
left hand corner of the Analyze Spectra tab.

```{r, fig.align="center", out.width="98%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/mainpage.jpg")
```

Open Specy allows for upload of native Open Specy .y(a)ml, .json, or .rds files.
In addition, .csv, .asp, .jdx, .0, .spa, .spc, and .zip files can be imported. To upload many files at once either select all the files you want to upload or zip the files together and upload the .zip file. Open Specy formats and .csv files should always load correctly
but the other file types are still in development, though most of the time these
files work perfectly. If uploading a .csv file, the simplest format is to label the column with the
wavenumbers `wavenumber` and name the column with the intensities `intensity`.
Wavenumber units must be cm^-1^. All other columns will be interpreted as additional spectra. Alternatively, spectra can be uploaded in wide csv format where some column names are in numerical format for the wavenumbers, rows will be interpreted as spectra, and any nonnumeric columns will be interpreted as metadata.  
Always keep a copy of the original files.

```{r sample_data, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::kable(head(raman_hdpe), caption = "Sample data `raman_hdpe`")
```

It is best practice to cross check files in the proprietary software they came
from and Open Specy before use in Open Specy. Due to the complexity of some
proprietary file types, we haven't been able to make them fully compatible yet.
If your file is not working, please contact the administrator and share the file
so that we can work on integrating it.

The specific steps to converting your instrument's native files to .csv can be
found in its software manual or you can check out
[Spectragryph](https://www.effemm2.de/spectragryph/), which supports many
spectral file conversions see [Spectragryph
Tutorial](https://raw.githack.com/wincowgerDEV/OpenSpecy-package/main/docs/articles/spectragryph.html).

If you don't have your own data, you can use a test dataset.

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/samplefile.jpg")
```

A .csv file of an HDPE Raman spectrum will download on your computer. This file
can also be used as a template for formatting .csv data into an Open Specy
accepted format.

# Visualization

## Spectra

In the app after spectral data are uploaded, it will appear in the main window.
This plot is selectable, zoomable, and provides information on hover. You can
also save a .png file of the plot view using the camera icon at the top right
when you hover over the plot. Any metadata pulled from the file is viewable below the plot. 

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/spectra_vis.jpg")
```


## Batches and Maps

Spectral maps (hyperspectral images) and many spectra at once can also be visualized as 
spatial information can be plotted as a heatmap. You can test this functionality using the Test Map from the drop down where Test Data is. Batch spectra are artificially projected into a spatial image based on their index. It is important to
note that when multiple spectra are uploaded in batch they are prescribed `x`
and `y` coordinates, this can be helpful for visualizing summary statistics and
navigating vast amounts of data but shouldn't be confused with map data (for example .hdr and .dat files) which
actually has spatial coordinates. Hovering over the map will reveal information
about the signal and noise and correlation values. Clicking the map will provide
the selected spectrum underneath the orange dot. In the app, the colors of the heatmap are colored based on the selection below map color. Signal/Noise will show the selection in Threshold Signal-Noise and other options become available depending on the analysis parameters selected. Pixels will appear black if the spectra does not
pass the signal-noise threshold and/or the correlation threshold.

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/map_vis.jpg")
```

# Processing

The goal of this processing is to increase the signal to noise ratio (S/N) without
distorting the shape or relative size of the peaks. We leave this option on by default to avoid accidentally analyzing raw spectra which results in poor identification. Once the process button is selected the default processing
will initiate. The default processing is an absolute derivative transformation, does something similar to smoothing, baseline subtraction, and
intensity correction quickly.

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/processing.jpg")
```

To view the raw data again, just deselect processing. Toggling processing
on and off can help you to make sure that the spectra are processed correctly.

## Threshold Signal-Noise

Considering whether you have enough signal to analyze spectra is important.
Classical spectroscopy would recommend your highest peak to be at least 10 times
the baseline of your processed spectra before you begin analysis. If your
spectra is below that threshold, you may want to consider recollecting it. In
practice, we are rarely able to collect spectra of that good quality and more
often use 5. The Signal Over Noise technique searches your spectra for high and
low regions and conducts division on them to derive the signal to noise ratio.
Signal Times Noise multiplies the mean signal by the standard deviation of the
signal and Total Signal sums the intensities. A histogram shows the threshold line at the value specified compared to the histogram of that metric for all the data. 

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/snr_threshold.jpg")
```

If analyzing spectra in batch, we recommend looking at the heatmap and
optimizing the percent of spectra that are above your signal to noise threshold
to determine the correct settings instead of looking through spectra
individually. This can be found in the Summary tab below the spectra. Good Signal tells you what percent of your data are above your
signal threshold.

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/signal_settings.jpg")
```

## Min-Max Normalize

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/min_max.jpg")
```

Min-max normalization is usually desired as it will convert spectral intensities to range from 0-1. If raw intensity units are desired, deselect this option. 

## Smoothing

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/smoothingpoly.jpg")
```

The value on the slider is
the polynomial order of the [Savitzky-Golay (SG)
filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter). Higher
numbers lead to more wiggly fits and thus less smooth, lower numbers lead to
more smooth fits. The SG filter is fit to a moving window of 11 data points (~90 wavenumber window) by
default where the center point in the window is replaced with the polynomial
estimate. Larger windows will produce smoother fits. The derivative order is set
to 1 by default which transforms the spectra to their first derivative. A zero
order derivative will have no derivative transformation. When smoothing is done
well, peak shapes and relative heights should not change. The absolute value is
primarily useful for first derivative spectra where the absolute value results
in an absorbance-like spectrum which is why we set it as the default. The default settings are needed for best identification results. 

## Conform wavenumbers

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/conform_wn.jpg")
```

Conforming spectra is essential before comparing to a reference library and can
be useful for summarizing data when you don't need it to be highly resolved
spectrally. In general if you intend to identify your spectra with our library we recommend not changing the wavenumber resolution as that can over or undersmooth your spectra relative to the library spectra. Linear interpolation is the best strategy for conforming wavenumbers but if you need speed nearest is much faster as it will just map wavenumbers to their nearest comformed value. 

## Intensity Adjustment

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/intensityadjustment.jpg")
```

Open Specy assumes that intensity units are in absorbance units but Open Specy
can adjust reflectance or transmittance spectra to absorbance units using this
selection. The transmittance adjustment uses the $\log_{10} 1/T$ calculation
which does not correct for system or particle characteristics. The reflectance
adjustment use the Kubelka-Munk equation $\frac{(1-R)^2}{2R}$. If none is
selected, Open Specy assumes that the uploaded data is an absorbance spectrum
and does not apply an adjustment.

## Baseline Correction

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/baselinecorrectionpoly.jpg")
```

The goal of baseline correction is to get all non-peak regions of the spectra to
zero absorbance. The higher the polynomial order, the more wiggly the fit to the
baseline. If the baseline is not very wiggly, a more wiggly fit could remove
peaks which is not desired. The baseline correction algorithm used in Open Specy
is called "iModPolyfit" (Zhao et al. 2007). This algorithm iteratively fits
polynomial equations of the specified order to the whole spectrum. During the
first fit iteration, peak regions will often be above the baseline fit. The data
in the peak region is removed from the fit to make sure that the baseline is
less likely to fit to the peaks. The iterative fitting terminates once the
difference between the new and previous fit is small or when the number of iterations has been reached, whichever is faster. If you select refit polynomial a final polynomial baseline will be fit to the resulting baseline data points. This will better maintain the noise of the baseline and may improve performance of baseline subtraction in some cases.

## Range Selection

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/rangeselection.jpg")
```

Sometimes an instrument operates with high noise at the ends of the spectrum
and, a baseline fit produces distortions, or there are regions of interest for
analysis. Range selection accomplishes those goals. Additionally, you can restrict the range
to examine a single peak or a subset of peaks of interests. The maximum and
minimum wavenumbers will specify the range to use.

## Flattening Ranges

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/flattten_example.jpg")
```

Sometimes there are peaks that really shouldn't be in your spectra and can
distort your interpretation of the spectra but you don't necessarily want to
remove the regions from the analysis because you believe those regions should be
flat instead of having a peak. One way to deal with this is to replace the peak
values with the mean of the values around the peak. This is the purpose of the
Flatten Range. By default it is set to flatten the CO2 region for
FTIR spectra because that region often needs to be flattened when atmospheric
artifacts occur in spectra. 

## Collapse Particle Spectra

When working with spectral images you can identify particles and get their shapes, sizes, and material types automatically. If you select the collapse particle spectra option it will enable this feature and you can download the collapsed particle spectra (averaged spectra for each particle) from the download tab. 
```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/collapse_spec.jpg")
```

When the heatmap is thresholded correctly particles will be isolated and these regions will be attributed to particles. For example there is one particle in the center of this heatmap. 

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/particle_example.jpg")
```

Collapsing the particles will also make a particle size plot appear in the summary tab. 

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/particle_size.jpg")
```

Whatever selection you have active will inform how your spectra is
thresholded. It should get thresholded in coincidence with what you see on the
spectral map. Pro tip: The file that gets downloaded is an OpenSpecy with median spectra for each of your thresholded particles. You can upload that back to the
app and analyze that independently.

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/download_threshold.jpg")
```

## Downloading Processed Data

You can download a csv file of your processed data using the Your Spectra option
with download. This will download a version of your spectra with whatever
processing options you have selected at the time.

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/download_yourspec.jpg")
```

# Identifying Spectra 

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/identification.jpg")
```

After uploading data and processing it (if desired) you can now identify the
spectrum. To identify the spectrum go to the **Identification** box. Pro tip: if
you select **Identification** without uploading data to the app, you'll be able
to explore the library by itself.

The identification options define the strategy for identification. 

The **Spectrum Type** will
inform which library is used. Both (default) will search both FTIR and Raman
libraries. 

**Library Transformation** controls the library to search based on how the spectra are transformed in the processing tab. Derivative will search against a derivative transformed library. No
Baseline will search against a baseline corrected library. 

**Library Type** will determine the library or model to use for the identification. Full is all of the spectra we have an includes 40k spectra. Medoid is a smaller library of the most important 4k spectra. Multinomial will use an AI multinomial regression to identify the spectra. 

**Threshold Correlation** will set the minimum value from matching to use as a
'positive identification' this will black out pixels in a spectral map view if
they are lower than the threshold and will reset identification values to unknown in downloaded results.

## Matches

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/matches.jpg")
```

Top matches in the app can be assessed by clicking the cog in the right hand
corner of the Spectra box. This will open a side window with the matches sorted
from most to least similar. Clicking on rows in the table will add the selected
match to the spectra viewer. The
red spectrum is the spectrum that you selected from the reference library and
the white spectrum is the spectrum that you are trying to identify. Using the table's filter options, you can restrict
the range of Pearson\'s r values or search for specific material types. The metadata of the selected library match wil be appended to the metadata of the file below the plot. Some of this metadata
may assist you in interpreting the spectra. For example, if the spectra has
metadata which says it is a liquid and you are analyzing a solid particle, that
spectrum may not be the best match.

## Download Top Matches

To download the top matches and associated metadata, use the top matches
download option. Top N controls the number of top matches to provide for each spectrum and Columns to Save will just save the simplest metadata for interpretation if set to simple or everything if set to all. 

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("app/download.jpg")
```


## Sharing Reference Data

If you have reference data or AI models that you think would be useful for
sharing with the spectroscopy community through OpenSpecy please contact the
website administrator to discuss options for collaborating.
