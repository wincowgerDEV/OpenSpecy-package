# OpenSpecy 1.7.0

- Improved run_app functionality to allow for version control. 
- Faster ENVI file reading. 
- Add area under band calculation. 

# OpenSpecy 1.5.0

## Major
- Update to vignettes for new functionality. 
- Improved plots
- Improved tests for Open Specy format. 
- Improved reading of csv files. 
- Improved reading of spa files. 
- Extended options for library version downloads.

# OpenSpecy 1.3.0

## Major
- added 2 new libraries a nobaseline and derivative version of medioid and model
- Created new function for spatial smooth without reading envi files
- Allow adj_intens to work on vectors or Open Specy objects

## Minor
- fixed bug with mac reading libraries

# OpenSpecy 1.2.0

## Potentially Breaking

- Removed share data options in all functions. They just weren't useful to users at all and were more of an administrative thing. Keeping them forced us to be incompatible with webR. 

## Major

- added support for siMPle files. 
- added support for xyz files. 
- added support for img files. 
- improved interactive plot popups. 
- changed how libraries are downloaded to avoid osfr pacakage. 
- increased support for options when collapsing maps. 
- avoid forcing min-max relative plots in interactive mode. 
- create static map option.

  with a set of new functions including `c_spec()` for concatenating spectra or
  converting them back to tables
- Various functions have been renamed and improved, for instance, to facilitate
  reading (and writing) spectral files
- New functions include `def_features()` to identify microplastics in spectral
  maps and `ai_classify()` to use AI for matching/identifying spectra
