## Comments

    Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
      preprocessing (46:5)
      wavenumber (47:62)

Both words are spelled correctly.

     installed size is  6.1Mb
     sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
       doc   4.6Mb

We tried to reduce the vignette size as much as possible but would like to keep
the current number of figures for better comprehensibility.
